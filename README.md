NetShuffler
===========

NetShuffler is an automatic network settings manager for Windows. It usescan be configured to
recognize network connections using DNS, IP subnet or NLA (Windows Network Location Awareness).
Once a network is recognized, it can execute profile actions including mapping network drives,
setting the default printer, connecting to a VPN or running a user-specified program.

The idea is that if you are a consultant and move between many different networks, you can have
all required network settings established automatically when you boot up at a particular location.

This project was developed as the capstone project for a BA in Computer Science at Thomas Edison
State University. The Word document "Capstone Project Report.docx" contains the written portion
of the assignment, which goes into a great deal more detail regarding the project's conception,
intent, capabilities, how to use it, how to compile it and so forth.
